Team Agreements

    Communication
    We will use messages for communication. Updates will be shared during weekly meetings. For urgent issues, we will use [e.g., phone or direct messages].

    Meeting Schedule
    Meetings will happen [once a week] on [day] at [time]. Everyone is expected to attend unless they provide notice 24 hours in advance.

    Decision-Making
    Decisions will be made through voting or agreement in team discussions. For urgent decisions, [e.g., group chat voting] will be used.

    Task Distribution
    Tasks will be assigned based on skills and preferences. If someone feels overwhelmed, they should communicate it. Everyone is responsible for tracking their progress and keeping the team updated.

    Conflict Resolution
    If conflicts arise, they will be discussed within the team. If not resolved, we will seek help (e.g., from a professor or teaching assistant).

    Code and Repository Management
    We will use [e.g., Git] for coding. Team members will follow these rules:
        Use clear commit messages.
        At least one other person must review pull requests before merging.

    Milestone Reflection
    After each milestone, we will reflect on what went well and where we can improve. This will guide adjustments to our agreements.
